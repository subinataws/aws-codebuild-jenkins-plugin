<div>

    Optional build artifact override. This is the build output artifact location.

    <ul>
        <li>If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output locations instead of AWS CodeBuild.

        <li>If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS, then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced.

        <li>If type is set to S3, this is the name of the output bucket.
    </ul>
