<div>
    Optional build artifact override. Along with path and name, the pattern that AWS CodeBuild will use to determine the name and location to store the output artifact, as follows:

    <ul>
        <li>If type is set to CODEPIPELINE, then AWS CodePipeline will ignore this value if specified. This is because AWS CodePipeline manages its build output names instead of AWS CodeBuild.

        <li>If type is set to NO_ARTIFACTS, then this value will be ignored if specified, because no build output will be produced.

        <li>If type is set to S3, then valid values include:

        <ul>
            <li>BUILD_ID: Include the build ID in the location of the build output artifact.

            <li>NONE: Do not include the build ID. This is the default if namespaceType is not specified.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    For example, if path is set to MyArtifacts, namespaceType is set to BUILD_ID, and name is set to MyArtifact.zip, then the output artifact would be stored in MyArtifacts/build-ID/MyArtifact.zip
