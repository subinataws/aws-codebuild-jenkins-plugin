    <p>
        In order to keep your application(s) more secure, this plugin only uses temporary credentials via STS, scoped to each application. To set this up, do one of the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Log into the AWS Management Console and navigate to the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/">Identity and Access Management console</a>.</li>
        <li>Click on <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/#roles">Roles</a>,  then click <strong>Create New Role</strong>.</li>
        <li>In the "Select Role Type" screen, click "Role for Cross-Account Access" then select <strong>Allows IAM users from a 3rd party AWS account to access this account.</strong></li>
        <li>The external ID for this Jenkins instance is listed below</li>
        <li>In the policy screen, select <strong>Next Step</strong> to skip this step (we'll attach a custom policy later).</li>
        <li>Give an appropriate name for this role (for example, "JenkinsCodeBuildProject").</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Create Role</strong>. </li>
        <li>Click on the newly-created role in the IAM dashboard. Under <strong>Permissions</strong>, click the <strong>Inline Policies</strong>,
            bar and create a new policy under <strong>Custom Policy</strong> with the following body:
            <ul>
                <li><code>
                    {"Statement": [{"Action": ["codebuild:*","iam:PassRole"],"Resource": "*","Effect": "Allow"},{"Action": ["logs:FilterLogEvents","logs:GetLogEvents"],"Resource": "*","Effect": "Allow"},{"Action": ["s3:CreateBucket","s3:GetObject","s3:List*","s3:PutObject","s3:GetBucket*"],"Resource": "*","Effect": "Allow"}],"Version": "2012-10-17"}
                </code></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Copy-paste the <strong>Role ARN</strong> into this field.</li>


    </ul>
