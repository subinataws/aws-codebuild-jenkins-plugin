<div>
    This option applies if you want to use the source code configured in Jenkins Source Code Management.
    This could mean your repository is in a Virtual Private Cloud or stored locally on your machine.
    You may need to install additional Jenkins plugins to allow Jenkins to find your source code.
    To use this option, your CodeBuild project source must have type S3. The bucket and key you specify will be
    where the plugin uploads your Jenkins source code.
