<div>
     Use the AWS access and secret keys for your user that has permission to call:<br>
     codebuild:StartBuild<br>
     codebuild:BatchGetBuilds<br>
     codebuild:BatchGetProjects<br>
     logs:GetLogEvents<br>
     s3:GetObject<br>
     If using Jenkins as source provider your user must also have permission to call:<br>
     s3:GetBucket<br>
     s3:PutObject<br>

     If the access key or secret key are not specified, the plugin will attempt to load credentials from the DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain.
