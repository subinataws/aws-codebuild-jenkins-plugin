<div>
    Choose to encrypt your source with server-side encryption using Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3).
    Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates.
    Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.
